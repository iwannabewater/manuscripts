###### Abstract

Agent performance is strongly shaped by the surrounding harness: the external execution system around a model that organizes a task run. Yet this logic is usually buried in tightly coupled controller code, which makes harnesses hard to inspect, compare, transfer, and ablate. This paper asks whether the reusable design pattern of an agent harness can be represented as an executable natural-language object. We introduce *Natural-Language Agent Harnesses* (NLAHs), editable documents that describe run-level harness policy, and *Intelligent Harness Runtime* (IHR), a shared runtime that interprets these documents into agent calls, handoffs, state updates, validation gates, and artifact contracts. Across coding, terminal-use, and computer-use benchmarks, IHR-executed NLAHs achieve comparable task outcomes to code and prompted realizations, while exposing much shorter static harness policies. Module ablations further show that explicit harness modules are analyzable. These results suggest that agent harnesses can be turned from incidental glue around models into scientific representation objects.

## 1 Introduction

Modern language-model agents have become multi-step execution systems. They use tools, keep state, recover from failures, validate intermediate results, and sometimes delegate work to other agents [^57] [^45] [^51] [^19] [^4]. These behaviors are organized by an external *harness*, which can have large effects on measured performance [^24] [^25] [^8]. Similar concerns appear in recent work on agent scaffolds, workflow generation, long-context execution, multi-agent orchestration, and tool-using agents [^38] [^5] [^6] [^17] [^33] [^15] [^47].

Figure 1: Three ways to control an agent run. The spectrum ranges from restrictive harnessing to no external harness, or self-harnessing. Code harnesses impose hard external control on a model through program logic. NLAH+IHR, the design point studied in this paper, moves the harness policy into readable natural language while a shared runtime executes that policy through child-agent calls. Self-harnessing is a possible future design in which a controller model directly harnesses other models without any external harness.

The problem is that harnesses are usually not represented as clean research objects. A code harness may mix prompts, tool adapters, parser rules, validation scripts, artifact paths, retry logic, context policy, and benchmark-specific assumptions in one controller bundle. As a result, a seemingly small harness change can also change call boundaries, tool mediation, state carriers, validation gates, and stopping semantics. This makes harnesses hard to inspect, port, compare, and ablate, even though the harness pattern itself is often the reusable part of the system.

This paper studies whether a harness pattern can be externalized as executable natural language. We propose *Natural-Language Agent Harnesses* (NLAHs), which write run-level harness policy as editable text, and *Intelligent Harness Runtime* (IHR), a shared runtime that executes this policy through agent calls. The key separation is simple: natural language carries the harness policy, while code and the runtime carry exact mechanisms such as tool execution, parsing, sandboxing, and logging.

We evaluate this idea with three connected questions. First, can IHR-executed NLAHs control real agent runs while preserving task performance comparable to code and prompted realizations? Second, do IHR-executed NLAHs materialize the intended harness mechanisms beyond using the same text as ordinary prompting? Third, once harness policy is explicit, can individual modules such as file-backed state, verifier separation, self-evolution, and multi-candidate search be analyzed as module-level interventions? Across coding, terminal-use, and computer-use benchmarks, our results show that NLAHs are executable and compact, that they leave measurable behavioral traces, and that module-level gains depend on whether a module aligns intermediate control with the benchmark’s acceptance condition.

Our contributions are as follows:

- We introduce NLAHs as explicit natural-language representations of agent harness patterns, distinct from both runtime policy and deterministic code hooks.
- We introduce IHR, a shared in-loop runtime that turns NLAHs into auditable agent calls, handoffs, state updates, validation gates, and artifact contracts.
- We explore the boundary between natural language and code in agent-harness systems, making a first step toward substantially broadening the scope of natural language from local instructions to harness-level strategy.
- We provide controlled evidence across three benchmark families that NLAHs can shape agent behavior with comparable task outcomes, expose concise static harness policies, and support module-level analysis.

## 2 Preliminaries

A *model* is a callable learned function from context $c$ to output $y$, where the context may include text, images, or video:

$$
y=\operatorname{LM}_{m}(c).
$$

An *agent* is a system that wraps one or more model calls with external interaction. An agent receives a task, maintains some execution state, observes feedback from tools or environments, and decides whether to continue acting, ask for information, validate progress, or stop. Thus, an agent is a model-centered execution process that can include multiple model calls and external actions. A single model call is a degenerate special case of an agent call, where the agent is allowed to call the model only once for a one-shot answer and performs no external action. In this paper, the atomic unit of harness execution is therefore an *agent call*. This choice lets NLAH describe harness behavior at the level where prompts, tools, state, validation, and delegation actually operate.

A *harness* is the external execution system around a model in an agent. It turns a base model into an agent that can act over real tasks by deciding what the model sees, what tools it may call, where state is stored, how observations are returned, when validation runs, how failures are recovered, when execution may stop, and how one or more model or agent calls are organized. *Harness engineering* is the practice of designing, implementing, adapting, debugging, and evaluating agent harnesses. Section˜D.1 summarizes descriptions of eleven main aspects of harness engineering. These include agent loops, tool design and documentation, context engineering, filesystem and workspace management, memory and state, validation and stopping conditions, safety permissions and sandboxing, runtime defaults, observability and replay, retry and recovery, and budget control.

## 3 Methodology

![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/2603.25723v2/fig/framework.png)

Figure 2: NLAH+IHR framework. A native code harness mixes policy and mechanism inside controller code. NLAH+IHR separates them: the NLAH stores readable harness policy, IHR provides shared execution semantics, and scripts or adapters handle exact operations such as tools, tests, parsers, and validators.

Inspired by reusable natural-language carriers such as AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, and SKILL.md, we consider extending natural-language documents from simple tool or workflow descriptions to broader harness-level strategies.

### 3.1 NLAHs and IHR

An NLAH+IHR system has four layers. The first layer is the *base agent*: a code-form minimal executable substrate. In our setting, the base agent is only an LLM loop: it can call a model, but the only external tool exposed to the model is a terminal. Through the terminal, the base agent can read and write files, run processes, record events, and launch child agents when needed. Launching a child agent does not require a separate dedicated tool: the base agent can use the terminal to start a new instance of itself and pass that instance a child task packet. The second layer is the *runtime policy*: a fixed instruction that turns the base agent into IHR by defining how it should interpret and execute harness documents. The third layer is the *NLAH*: the natural-language policy document that describes the stages, roles, state rules, verification rules, recovery rules, and stopping conditions of a task run. The fourth layer is the set of *scripts and adapters*: deterministic code used for exact operations such as running tests, parsing results, calling benchmark tools, or checking artifacts.

This separation is the main design choice. The base agent and adapters provide the machine interface. The runtime policy provides shared execution semantics. The NLAH provides the per-harness policy.

IHR is intentionally thin, containing the base agent and the text-form runtime policy. It uses the base agent as an orchestrator guided by the runtime policy and delegates substantive task work to child agents. For a nominally single-agent harness, IHR still realizes the run as a parent orchestrator plus one executor child, so the boundary between harness control and task execution remains visible. For multi-role or multi-branch harnesses, IHR launches separate child agents, passes each agent only the intended task packet, supervises handoff, and records the resulting behavior. Thus, IHR is not a large bespoke controller for one benchmark; it is a shared runtime that gives natural-language harness policy a common execution substrate.

The NLAH is the part that changes from one harness to another. It specifies what the run should do and leaves low-level operations to the runtime, tools, and hooks. For example, an NLAH can state when to create a task state file, when to ask a verifier to inspect a patch, what evidence must be preserved before answering, when a retry is allowed, and what condition closes the run. The runtime then instantiates these clauses through model calls, child-agent messages, tool calls, files, and deterministic hooks. NLAHs extend beyond ordinary prompts: they describe the lifecycle of a task run and cover subsequent multi-step execution.

We keep deterministic code where precision matters. Tests, parsers, sandboxing, benchmark adapters, and artifact validators remain in code because they require exact and reproducible behavior. Natural language is used for policy: task decomposition, role contracts, evidence discipline, retry logic, state handoff, and validation strategy. This division of labor avoids the overclaim that natural language can replace all controller code, while still moving the most inspectable part of harness design out of opaque implementation logic. Section˜D.2 gives the natural-language/code boundary and maps code-harness aspects to the IHR+NLAH carriers.

### 3.2 Notes on writing NLAHs

In our experiments, an NLAH is a compact policy document that makes the harness decisions explicit. We found the following writing principles useful.

#### State the task contract first.

An NLAH should begin by defining the input, the expected output, the allowed tools or artifacts, and the condition under which the run is complete. This prevents later sections from becoming vague advice. For coding tasks, the contract may specify patch location, test evidence, and final answer format. For computer-use tasks, it may specify the target application state, allowed interaction channels, and completion evidence.

#### Separate stages from mechanisms.

The NLAH should name the stages of the run—for example, inspect, plan, edit, verify, recover, and finalize—but it should not reimplement every low-level tool operation in prose. Low-level operations are better handled by scripts, adapters, and runtime hooks. The NLAH should instead define when those mechanisms are used and what evidence they must produce.

#### Make state and evidence explicit.

Long-horizon agents fail when useful intermediate information is lost or when a final answer is produced without auditable evidence. A readable NLAH should therefore specify where state is stored, which artifacts must be reopened by later agents, what evidence supports a claim, and which files or logs close the run. This is especially important for file-backed state, verifier modules, and evidence-backed answering.

#### Write module boundaries so they can be ablated.

A module is useful for research only if it can be removed or changed without silently changing the rest of the harness. NLAH sections should therefore use clear names for modules such as verifier, self-evolution, multi-candidate search, context compression, or markdown memory. This lets us ask whether a module changes task outcomes, process metrics, or solved-set composition under a shared runtime.

#### Prefer simple and enforceable language.

NLAHs should use short clauses, concrete conditions, and explicit artifacts. Phrases such as “be careful,” “think deeply,” or “act like an expert” are weak harness policy because they do not define observable behavior. By contrast, clauses such as “write a state file before delegating,” “run the verifier only after producing a candidate patch,” or “do not finalize without evidence from the target file” are easier for IHR to execute and easier for researchers to audit. Section˜D.2 gives the detailed expressivity boundary.

## 4 Experimental Design

### 4.1 Research questions

We evaluate whether harness pattern logic can be compared across implementation media, audited through harness mechanisms, and analyzed as explicit modules.

- RQ1 (Harness Realization). Can NLAHs shape observable agent behavior while maintaining comparable task outcomes, and how does this control compare with native code harnesses and prompted NLAHs?
- RQ2 (Harness Mechanism Realization). Do IHR-executed NLAHs preserve and materialize intended harness mechanisms, such as workflow structure, contract enforcement, tool use, recovery, and information handoff?
- RQ3 (Module Ablation). Once harness modules are expressed in natural language, can they be cleanly ablated and analyzed at the module level?

### 4.2 Harness realizations

RQ1 compares three realizations of the same harness idea, ordered by how directly the harness can control execution.

- Code Harness denotes the original code implementation of the studied agent harness family: the controller code, workflow scripts, framework defaults, and tool adapters that realize the harness before it is represented as an NLAH. It provides the strongest and most deterministic control, but its policy is interleaved with implementation details.
- Prompted NLAH denotes the same NLAH content provided as ordinary prompt or instruction text to the Codex CLI agent, without IHR’s shared runtime charter and execution semantics. It tests how much control is available when natural language is only a passive instruction carrier.
- IHR-executed NLAH denotes NLAH interpreted and executed by IHR, with explicit runtime semantics for child lifecycle, artifact and state handling, contract gates, and stopping. It gives up the hard determinism of a code harness, but gives the natural-language policy an execution substrate that can materialize roles, handoffs, state, and verification boundaries.

### 4.3 Benchmarks and harness families

We evaluate on three representative benchmark families that require multi-step control, tool use, durable state accumulation, and verification or evidence management.

#### Coding.

SWE-bench Verified evaluates repository-grounded issue resolution; the main metric is issue resolution rate [^21] [^14]. We study coding harness families including Live-SWE-Agent [^53].

#### Terminal-use capability.

Terminal-Bench 2.0 (TB2) evaluates long-horizon command-line tasks in Linux environments; the main metric is task success [^35]. Meta-Harness is an agent-driven technique that automatically debugs and optimizes executable code harnesses [^26]. We study MHTBA, the state-of-the-art terminal-use code harness produced by Meta-Harness for Terminal-Bench 2.0 with Claude Opus 4.6 [^46].

#### Computer use.

OSWorld evaluates computer-use behavior grounded in real desktop environments; the main metric is task success rate [^55]. For OSWorld, we report a SeeAct-style GUI harness family [^63].

### 4.4 Experimental setup

All experiments use the same IHR instantiation: Codex CLI version 0.123.0, model gpt-5.4-mini [^39], and reasoning effort xhigh. Runs execute on Ubuntu 24.04 servers with 64 CPU cores and 251 GiB of memory. To improve reproducibility and sandbox safety, all runs are executed in Docker containers. Per-task container caps are 32 vCPUs, 84 GiB memory, and 40 GiB storage.

## 5 Results

### 5.1 RQ1: Harness realization

Table 1: RQ1: NLAH execution preserves competitive task performance while exposing process costs. Perf. is the benchmark primary percentage metric. Code denotes the native code harness, Prompt denotes the same NLAH text used as ordinary instructions, and NLAH denotes IHR-executed NLAH. Token and call metrics report the observable process cost of each realization.

| Benchmark | Harness | Type | Perf. | LLM Calls | Tool Calls | Pr. Tok. | Comp. Tok. | Run time (min) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SWE Verified | Live-SWE | Code | 67.00 | 23.30 | 17.70 | 283.60k | 3.50k | 28.90 |
|  |  | Prompt | 77.00 | 36.40 | 48.00 | 2.20M | 27.50k | 5.70 |
|  |  | NLAH | 73.00 | 41.00 | 63.40 | 2.20M | 32.30k | 6.10 |
| TB2 | MHTBA | Code | 36.00 | 223.20 | 122.90 | 10.40M | 17.50k | 19.50 |
|  |  | Prompt | 57.30 | 41.50 | 48.00 | 3.10M | 51.80k | 11.10 |
|  |  | NLAH | 53.90 | 56.40 | 78.00 | 4.20M | 74.80k | 13.50 |
| OSWorld | SeeAct | Code | 47.10 | 23.30 | 47.80 | 1.40M | 8.90k | 9.00 |
|  |  | Prompt | 47.90 | 35.30 | 39.20 | 1.10M | 12.30k | 4.90 |
|  |  | NLAH | 46.30 | 40.90 | 48.60 | 1.10M | 13.60k | 5.50 |

RQ1 asks whether harness policy can be moved from code into an NLAH without losing the ability to control real agent runs. We compare three realizations: the native code harness, the same NLAH used as ordinary instructions, and the same NLAH executed by IHR. This design separates two questions: whether natural-language harness policy is expressive enough, and whether a shared runtime gives that policy stronger execution semantics than prompting alone. The results are shown in Table˜1.

#### IHR-executed NLAHs are operationally viable.

Across the audited settings, NLAHs achieve task performance in the same regime as the corresponding code harnesses. On Live-SWE, IHR-executed NLAH reaches 73.0, above the native code harness at 67.0 and close to the prompted NLAH at 77.0. On OSWorld, NLAH reaches 46.3, essentially matching the code harness at 47.1. On MHTBA, NLAH reaches 53.9, below the prompted version at 57.3 but far above the native code realization at 36.0. A detailed analysis of the MHTBA code artifact’s TB2 portability is given in Appendix˜C. These results support the central feasibility claim: NLAH and IHR together can drive real multi-step agent behavior.

#### The cost profile reflects prototype-runtime engineering overhead.

NLAHs often use more model calls, tool calls, or tokens than code harnesses. This is expected in the current implementation because IHR is built on a general agent substrate and uses natural-language orchestration, which adds overhead relative to a hand-specialized controller. The important point is that this cost does not destroy task performance. In several cases, the added autonomy lets the model choose action granularity more flexibly than a rigid controller, which helps explain why Live-SWE NLAH is both competitive and much faster in wall-clock time than the native code harness. Thus, the current cost profile should be read as an engineering target; it does not show that the representation is unusable.

#### NLAHs expose the policy layer that code harnesses hide.

The conciseness audit in Table˜2 shows the strongest representation-level result. For Live-SWE, the readable harness policy is reduced from 60.1k tokens of code materials to a 2.9k-token NLAH. For MHTBA, it is reduced from 10.5k to 0.8k tokens. This means the high-level policy—state handling, validation, recovery, candidate search, and completion gates—is separated from deterministic mechanisms and becomes directly inspectable. That separation is what enables mechanism-level auditing in RQ2 and module-level ablation in RQ3.

#### Behavior is flexible but still policy-guided.

The OSWorld cases illustrate why NLAH is best viewed as a policy layer operating at the level of goals, evidence, and gates. The NLAH preserves staged observation, action selection, recovery, and completion checking, but it may choose a different concrete route when that route satisfies the same completion contract. For example, GUI-oriented tasks can sometimes be completed through shell commands, file edits, or package-level operations that provide clearer evidence. This flexible routing preserves harness control and reflects the intended benefit of expressing policy at the level of goals, evidence, and gates; the policy need not prescribe every action primitive.

#### Takeaway.

RQ1 supports the first claim of the paper: harness policy can be externalized into compact natural language and executed by a shared runtime while preserving competitive task outcomes. The main remaining gap is engineering efficiency: reducing handoff loss, fixed context overhead, and redundant orchestration calls in the prototype runtime.

Table 2: RQ1: NLAHs expose the reusable harness policy in fewer static materials. Counts include audited static NLAH files and corresponding code-harness implementation materials, not runtime prompts or generated logs.

### 5.2 RQ2: Harness mechanism realization

RQ2 asks whether IHR-executed NLAHs materialize the intended harness mechanisms in addition to matching task scores. We define and use new pattern-preservation and harness-engineering metrics for the settings where logs expose the required event structure. Because NLAHs deliberately operate at the level of policy, contracts, and gates, the audit focuses on whether expected mechanisms such as workflow structure, stage coverage, tool use, contract enforcement, recovery, and handoff appear in the run.

Table 3: RQ2: NLAHs preserve recognizable harness-pattern structure. Except for Verification Signals, the Code row is the reference harness and therefore does not receive one-way similarity scores.

| Benchmark | Harness | Type | Verification Signals | Prompt Contract | Tool Surface | Workflow Pres. | Stage Cov. | Ordered Workflow | Context Boundary | Model Match |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SWE Verified | Live-SWE | Code | 3.99 | \- | \- | \- | \- | \- | \- | \- |
| SWE Verified | Live-SWE | Prompt | 6.51 | 0.89 | 0.82 | 0.70 | 0.75 | 0.74 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| SWE Verified | Live-SWE | NLAH | 9.89 | 0.81 | 0.87 | 0.67 | 0.82 | 0.78 | 0.76 | 0.76 |
| Terminal-Bench 2.0 | MHTBA | Code | 45.05 | \- | \- | \- | \- | \- | \- | \- |
| Terminal-Bench 2.0 | MHTBA | Prompt | 13.18 | 1.00 | 0.81 | 0.64 | 0.57 | 0.53 | 1.00 | 0.99 |
| Terminal-Bench 2.0 | MHTBA | NLAH | 22.82 | 0.84 | 0.80 | 0.63 | 0.57 | 0.54 | 0.81 | 0.55 |

#### NLAHs preserve recognizable workflow structure.

Table˜3 shows that NLAH runs keep nontrivial prompt-contract, tool-surface, workflow-preservation, stage-coverage, and ordered-workflow scores relative to the reference harnesses. On Live-SWE, NLAH raises Verification Signals to 9.890 and improves Stage Coverage and Ordered Workflow over prompted execution. On MHTBA, NLAH has nearly the same Workflow Preservation as Prompt, slightly higher Stage Coverage and Ordered Workflow, and lower Context Boundary and Model Match because parent-child execution changes the topology and distributes work across parent and child contexts. These metrics support the same qualitative point as RQ1’s behavioral discussion: NLAH execution is policy-guided execution.

Table 4: RQ2: NLAHs instantiate harness-engineering mechanisms. For Prompt, Orchestration Reliability and Information Handoff Recall use direct-context variants; for NLAH, they use parent-child handoff variants.

| Benchmark | Harness | Type | Artifact Contract | Tool Call Success | Failed Tool Continuation | Cached Token Ratio | Orchestration Reliability | Information Handoff Recall |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SWE Verified | Live-SWE | Code | 0.99 | 0.88 | 0.95 | 0.71 | NA | NA |
| SWE Verified | Live-SWE | Prompt | 0.99 | 0.93 | 0.98 | 0.96 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| SWE Verified | Live-SWE | NLAH | 1.00 | 0.93 | 0.99 | 0.94 | 0.83 | 0.32 |
| Terminal-Bench 2.0 | MHTBA | Code | NA | 0.95 | 0.79 | 0.00 | NA | NA |
| Terminal-Bench 2.0 | MHTBA | Prompt | 1.00 | 0.92 | 1.00 | 0.96 | 0.99 | 1.00 |
| Terminal-Bench 2.0 | MHTBA | NLAH | 0.96 | 0.93 | 1.00 | 0.94 | 0.85 | 0.55 |

#### The strongest mechanism evidence appears in contracts, tools, and recovery.

Table˜4 shows high artifact-contract compliance, tool-call success, and continuation after failed tool calls for IHR-executed NLAHs. On Live-SWE, NLAH reaches 1.000 Artifact Contract, 0.933 Tool Call Success, and 0.992 Failed Tool Continuation. On MHTBA, the corresponding values are 0.955, 0.928, and 0.995. These numbers indicate that IHR turns instructions from text into observable artifacts, tool-mediated execution, and recovery behavior.

#### The main mechanism weakness is handoff.

The same table also identifies the main runtime bottleneck. NLAH Orchestration Reliability is lower than Prompt on both Live-SWE and MHTBA, and Information Handoff Recall drops from the direct-context Prompt setting to 0.322 and 0.553 under parent-child execution. This weakness is consistent with the cost profile in RQ1: the prototype runtime already materializes harness mechanisms, but loses information across boundaries that ordinary prompting does not create.

#### Takeaway.

RQ2 separates the mechanism claim from RQ1’s outcome claim. The same runs show that NLAH+IHR remains competitive on task outcomes and also produces auditable workflow, contract, verification, tool-use, recovery, and handoff signals. The main remaining gap is therefore more specific than generic overhead: IHR needs better handoff and orchestration reliability.

### 5.3 RQ3: Module ablation

Table 5: RQ3: Explicit NLAH modules can be ablated under a shared runtime. Each row adds one module to a benchmark-specific Basic condition. Perf. is the main benchmark metric, and Agent Calls measures changes in execution topology. Values should be compared within the same benchmark column, not across benchmark families.

RQ3 asks whether explicit NLAH modules support meaningful intervention under a shared runtime. We analyze Table˜5 from a global perspective: which module families help across benchmarks, which ones mainly change process shape, and which ones add cost or branching without improving the path to benchmark acceptance. The discussion compares modules within each reported benchmark; averaging scores across benchmark families would be inappropriate. We keep the two most consequential observations in the main text and move the remaining module-specific discussion to Section˜F.1.

#### The strongest modules tighten state and acceptance discipline.

Two modules stand out. *File-backed state* improves both benchmarks, from 73.0 to 75.6 on SWE and from 44.4 to 58.3 on OSWorld. *Self-evolution* is even stronger on the solve loop itself, reaching 78.8 on SWE and 52.8 on OSWorld. *Evidence-backed answering* is also consistently positive, though more modestly, with gains of +2.8 on both benchmarks. The common pattern is important: the modules that help most make the acceptance path cleaner by preserving state, forcing explicit evidence, or sharpening the retry decision.

#### Extra branching is not the same as better control.

*Multi-candidate search* produces the clearest topology change. Agent Calls jump from 1.1 to 5.7 on SWE and from 1.083 to 1.333 on OSWorld, but this extra branching yields only +2.8 on OSWorld and a drop from 73.0 to 71.4 on SWE. This is a useful negative result. Explicit branching does change the search behavior, but under the current runtime and budget it is too expensive and too infrastructure-sensitive to dominate simpler modules. More search is not automatically better harness design.

#### Global takeaway.

RQ3 therefore supports a clear paper-level conclusion. Explicit NLAH modules are useful when they shorten the path from intermediate work to auditable evidence and final benchmark acceptance. They are less useful when they mainly add local process layers, extra branching, or compressed summaries whose notion of success can drift away from the evaluator. This is exactly the kind of conclusion that is hard to reach when harness logic stays buried inside code: once the modules become explicit, we can see whether they help and *how* they help.

#### Agent harnesses and scaffold-aware evaluation.

Recent agent systems show that performance depends on the execution scaffold around the model, including tools, feedback loops, state, validation, and workflow structure [^57] [^27] [^45] [^19] [^37] [^4]. Code-harness synthesis, scaffold-aware benchmarks, agent graph compilation, and multi-agent routing or orchestration further make this dependence explicit [^34] [^13] [^17] [^3] [^61] [^60] [^56] [^50] [^52] [^59] [^22] [^16]. These works motivate our setting. Our focus is whether the harness policy itself can be externalized as editable natural language and executed under a shared runtime.

#### Natural-language instruction carriers.

Files such as prompts, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, AgentSkills, and related skill bundles show that operational knowledge can be packaged as reusable text and attached to agent runs [^1] [^2]. Recent skill and memory work extends this idea by learning, evolving, storing, and transferring reusable procedures [^20] [^58] [^36] [^62] [^28] [^30] [^29] [^10] [^42] [^54]. NLAHs are related but operate at a different level. NLAHs operate at the run-level harness-policy layer, specifying roles, call boundaries, state carriers, evidence gates, recovery rules, and stopping criteria.

#### Natural language as programs, workflows, and constraints.

Prompt programming, promptware, and language-model programming frameworks such as LMQL, DSPy, APPL, and SGLang treat prompts and LLM calls as programmable objects [^32] [^12] [^11] [^7] [^23] [^18] [^65]. Other work compiles natural language into workflows, graphs, runtime constraints, or executable specifications [^31] [^64] [^44] [^49] [^43] [^41] [^40]. NLAHs share the premise that natural language can carry executable intent. They differ in scope: the target object is the agent harness over a full task run, extending beyond an individual call, a fixed pipeline, or a formal workflow graph. NLAHs deliberately keep a freer natural-language form to preserve editability and broad expressivity, while relying on IHR and deterministic hooks for execution.

## 7 Conclusion

We studied whether agent harness policy can be externalized as a compact, executable, and analyzable representation. We introduced Natural-Language Agent Harnesses and an Intelligent Harness Runtime that executes these harnesses under shared runtime semantics. Across coding, terminal-use, and computer-use benchmarks, IHR-executed NLAHs remain competitive with native harnesses while making the policy layer much shorter and easier to inspect. Mechanism audits and module ablations further show that explicit harness documents can support process-level inspection and mechanism-level analysis.
